# ðŸ“œ Radhwan Hassine -- @Takipher

Embedded systems engineering student at HEPIA (Geneva), currently in my final bachelor year.

I'm interested in:
- Low-level development (C)
- Hardware design (FPGA, Verilog, RISC-V)

## Current projects
- RISC-V processor written in Verilog
- This year, I'll also work on my bachelor thesis â€” most likely an FPGA-based project
